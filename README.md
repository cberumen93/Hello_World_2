# Hello_World_2
This is my second time going through the github hello world guide. I created my github account in order to participate in a udemy course I'm taking. 
My name is Christian Berumen. I am twenty-four years old and I'm learning to be a web developer. I live in Buckeye, AZ, USA but I'm from San Diego, CA, USA.
